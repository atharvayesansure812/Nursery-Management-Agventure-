## OUR GOAL:
Our goal is to support thousands of smallholder farmers and plant nursery owners across India, by providing them with a app who can sell their crops and various plants.
And this app gives a platform to the farmers and nursery owners to sell their products directly to the consumers.

## Description
* This is a flutter app made by our team AGVENTURE. 
* The first page of our app consists of two buttons i.e. BUYER & SELLER.
* The seller can easily upload their products and the buyer can easily buy those products.

Add your project description here. Your project description should cover how your website/app works. That way you can convey what your project is without the need for anyone to view the code. A more detailed readme in your project repository is encouraged, which can include build and use instructions etc.

* Use bullet points for any feature descriptions you may want to add


Don't forget to replace the link here with **_your own Github repository_** link.

Along with this, add the link of the drive folder that contains the app APK/Screenshots/Screen Recordings. If you have hosted your project on the web, add that link as well.

* GitHub repo link: [Link to repository](https://github.com/your-repo-link)
* Drive link: [Drive link here](https://drive.google.com/)
